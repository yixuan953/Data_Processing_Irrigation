ncks: WARNING nco_cpy_var_dfn_trv() reports variable "lat" output type = NC_DOUBLE does not equal input type = NC_FLOAT. This is legal yet usually ill-advised when appending variables (i.e., with -A). Writing values into slots created for a different type is begging for trouble (e.g., data corruption, truncation, gingivitis).
